Hello, I am Garrett Hanberg, a graduate of The Tech Academy's Software Developer Boot Camp. During my time there, I gained a comprehensive understanding of various software and web languages, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Django, C#, .NET, ASP.NET, MVC, SQL and more. I am confident in my abilities as a full-stack software developer and have demonstrated this through several coding projects, which can be found in my repositories. If you are interested in learning more about my skills and experience, please do not hesitate to contact me at garretthanbergphoto@gmail.com. I am eager to put my expertise to work and make a positive impact in a new role.
